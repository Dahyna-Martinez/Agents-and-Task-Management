    Modified N-Queens problem for use with hill climbing.
    The goal is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

    Attributes:
        N (int): The number of queens (and board size).
        initial (tuple): The initial state representing queen positions in each column.

    Methods:
        actions(state): Returns all possible moves by changing a queen's row in any column.
        result(state, action): Returns a new state with the given move applied.
        value(state): Computes the heuristic value based on the number of attacking queen pairs.

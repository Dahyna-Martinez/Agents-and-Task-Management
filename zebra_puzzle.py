Logic Puzzle Performance Report

status of the puzzle (Success or Failure), the execution time of the algorithm to solve the puzzle, and the amount of actions the 
algorithm required to do to attempt to solve the problem. The report for each algorithm is displayed in the terminal as each algorithm is executed.
